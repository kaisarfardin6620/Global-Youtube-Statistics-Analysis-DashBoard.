This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of YouTube channel performance and its relation to socioeconomic factors, presented across two 
pages. **Page 1** focuses on individual YouTuber performance, featuring visuals such as the top 10 YouTubers by subscribers, a scatter plot comparing video
views and subscribers (with uploads as bubble sizes), monthly earnings ranges, category distribution via a donut chart, and a country-wise map of uploads. 
**Page 2** shifts to country and economic insights, showcasing top countries by subscribers (stacked by category), a scatter plot analyzing the relationship
between gross tertiary education enrollment and unemployment rate, a tree map of channel types by country, a heatmap of video views for the last 30 days, and 
a line chart of subscriber growth over time. Dynamic slicers for country, category, channel type, and created year allow interactive filtering across visuals. Key performance indicators (KPIs) like total video views, uploads, and education enrollment rates provide high-level metrics. The dataset includes columns such as YouTuber rank, subscribers, video views, earnings, uploads, country details, education enrollment, unemployment rate, and geographic coordinates. The dashboard uses a variety of visuals, including bar charts, scatter plots, line charts, tree maps, and maps, to deliver meaningful insights with interactivity and cross-filtering. This project is designed for in-depth exploration of YouTube performance and regional trends, making it a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making.
